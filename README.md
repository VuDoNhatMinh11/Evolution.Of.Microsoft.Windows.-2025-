                        Windows 1.0 was the first major release of Microsoft Windows, a family of graphical operating systems for personal computers. It was launched in the United States on November 20, 1985, and the European version followed as Windows 1.02 in May 1986. Windows 1.0 ran on top of MS-DOS and provided a 16-bit shell program known as MS-DOS Executive. It introduced features like multitasking, mouse support, and built-in programs such as Calculator, Paint, and Notepad. However, it received mixed reviews due to compatibility issues and performance limitations. Windows 1.0 was succeeded by Windows 2.0 in December 1987. If you're curious about more recent Windows versions, you might want to explore Windows 10, which is available for download.

                        Windows 2.x is the second major version of Microsoft Windows, released in 1987 as a successor to Windows 1.0. It introduced several improvements over its predecessor, including overlapping windows, menu keyboard shortcuts, VGA support, and other user interface enhancements influenced by IBM standards. Notably, Windows 2.x is the last version that supports installation to a floppy disk and is available as an application run-time. Later editions added support for 286 high memory and running applications in a 386 VDM. Interestingly, during the Windows 2.x era, Microsoft briefly considered dropping Windows in favor of OS/2, but development refocused on Windows 3.0 and what would become Windows NT.

                        Windows 3.0 is the third major release of Microsoft Windows, launched in 1990. Unlike its predecessors, it introduced a graphical user interface (GUI) that represented applications as clickable icons, rather than just listing file names. Notable features included improved multitasking, customizability, and efficient memory management. Windows 3.0 also supported multimedia features like sound recording and playback, as well as CD-ROMs. It performed well both critically and commercially, challenging Apple Macintosh and Unix GUIs. Microsoft bundled separate software with the operating environment, which drew criticism from third-party developers. With 10 million sales, Windows 3.0 paved the way for its successor, Windows 3.1, released in 1992.

It introduced TrueType fonts, which made Windows a viable publishing platform for the first time. Other key improvements included a redesigned Program Manager, better mouse support, and multimedia extensions. Windows 3.1 was a major commercial success, selling over three million copies in its first two months.

                        Windows NT 3.1 is the first major release of the Windows NT operating system developed by Microsoft. It was released on July 27, 1993. Unlike its predecessor, Windows 3.1, which relied on the DOS operating system for essential functions and had a constrictive 16-bit architecture, Windows NT 3.1 was a complete 32-bit operating system. It retained a desktop environment familiar to Windows 3.1 users while offering improved security and stability. The name "Windows NT" (which stands for "New Technology") signaled that this was a re-engineered version of Windows. Initially demonstrated at Comdex 1991, Windows NT 3.1 was available in two editions: Windows NT 3.1 for workstations and Windows NT 3.1 Advanced Server for servers. Although its sales were limited due to high system requirements and a lack of 32-bit applications, it paved the way for subsequent versions like Windows NT 3.5.

It introduced a more user-friendly interface, including features like the Taskbar and Start Menu. This version was the first to include the Modern Windows Feel that users recognize today.
